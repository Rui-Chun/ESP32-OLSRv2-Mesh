# ESP32-OLSR/MESH

## To Run
- This project is tested on several ESP32 dev boards. Other ESP32 devices should also work.
- This project is developed with (ESP-IDF v4.2)[https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf]. You can compile and flash this project folowing the same approach for any example of ESP-IDF.

## More details
This project is developed based on the ESPNOW feature, an ad-hoc feature of ESP-32. With some modification, ESP-32 can achieve quick ad-hoc transmissions. So I built a Mesh network implementation accroding to OLSRv2. PLease check (this document)[https://github.com/Rui-Chun/ESP32-OLSRv2-Mesh/blob/main/CS434_Project_Report.pdf] for more details if you are interested.
